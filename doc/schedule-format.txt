Format for the schedule file

The schedule file is a text file with each line providing a command to
a simple, stack-based interpreter.  The commands are as follows:

# ...
        Comment line

c C_1 C_2 ... C_k
        Retrieve specified clauses and push onto stack

a K
        Pop K+1 elements.  Compute their conjunction and push result onto stack

q V_1 V_2 ... V_k
        Pop top element of stack.  Existentially quantify it by
        specified variables and push result onto stack

i Docstring
        Print out BDD information about top element on stack, using Docstring as description

(=|=2|>=) b A_1.V_1 A_2.V_2 ... A_k.V_k  (Current implementqation only supports =2)
	Generate a BDD representation of the specified pseudo-Boolean
	constraint.
	Pop current stack and prove that it implies the PB constraint.
	Push the PB constraint.
        '=' denotes integer equation, '=2" denotes modulo-2 equation,
	and '>=" denotes ordering constraint
	
g N V_1 V_2 ... V_k
        Pop N equations from the stack and Perform Gauss-Jordan elimination on them.
	Variables V_1, V_2, ..., V_k are internal to the equations.
