Program: xtree

Something is corrupting bddfreepos, when run with N=137.  Gets value
875442464, even though node array only 200003.  Fairly robust to
benchmark parameters.  Also happens when use node array of size
100003.

Bug occurs in bdd_makenode, as retrieve node from free list.  Call
with level = 385, high = 5448, low = 0.

Global values:
       bddfreenum 925905966 ??
       bddproduced 80023
       bddresized 0  (Means that no resizing has taken place)

Also find that it has problems in proof generation for N>=121.  (Bug manifests itself different for different values of N.)

Suspect that something is corrupting the global state.
